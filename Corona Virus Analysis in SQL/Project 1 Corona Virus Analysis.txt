Diving into Corona Virus Data!

This project puts your SQL and data analysis skills to the test in a real-world scenario. 
We're on a mission to understand the spread of COVID-19.

Imagine you're a data analyst tasked with analyzing a massive dataset on the virus. 
Your job is to uncover valuable insights and present them in a clear, compelling way.

Dataset:

Description of each column in dataset:

Province: Geographic subdivision within a country/region.

Country/Region: Geographic entity where data is recorded.

Latitude: North-south position on Earth's surface.

Longitude: East-west position on Earth's surface.

Date: Recorded date of CORONA VIRUS data.

Confirmed: Number of diagnosed CORONA VIRUS cases.

Deaths: Number of CORONA VIRUS related deaths.

Recovered: Number of recovered CORONA VIRUS cases.


What you have to do?
For tasks details, You have to find the answers by writing SQL queries:

 To avoid any errors, check missing value / null value 
-- Q1. Write a code to check NULL values

--Q2. If NULL values are present, update them with zeros for all columns. 

-- Q3. check total number of rows

-- Q4. Check what is start_date and end_date

-- Q5. Number of month present in dataset

-- Q6. Find monthly average for confirmed, deaths, recovered

-- Q7. Find most frequent value for confirmed, deaths, recovered each month 

-- Q8. Find minimum values for confirmed, deaths, recovered per year

-- Q9. Find maximum values of confirmed, deaths, recovered per year

-- Q10. The total number of case of confirmed, deaths, recovered each month

-- Q11. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to confirmed case
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q12. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to death case per month
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q13. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to recovered case
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q14. Find Country having highest number of the Confirmed case

-- Q15. Find Country having lowest number of the death case

-- Q16. Find top 5 countries having highest recovered case
